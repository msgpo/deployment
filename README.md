Toronto Mesh Deployment Planning
================================

This repo is used to coordinate deployment of Toronto Mesh nodes in an open and transparent workflow.

While most of the discussions happen in [#deployment:tomesh.net](https://chat.tomesh.net/#/room/#deployment:tomesh.net), key discussions are summarized in Github Issues of this repo. Architectual decisions and designs that can be reusable for other mesh communities, such as [cjdns-mesh-isp](./docs/cjdns-mesh-isp.md), should be committed to the repo so they are forkable.
